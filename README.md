GraphQL Learning Project
Overview
This project is designed to help you learn GraphQL on both the client and server sides. It includes a GraphQL server implementation and a client-side application that interacts with the server. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of GraphQL, including schema design, queries, mutations, and integration with frontend technologies.

Server-side (Backend)
Technologies
GraphQL: The query language for APIs.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the server.
Apollo Server: GraphQL server implementation for Node.js.
Express: Web framework for Node.js.
MongoDB: NoSQL database (optional, based on your choice).
Getting Started
Clone the repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/graph-ql-learning-project.git
cd graph-ql-learning-project
Install dependencies

bash
Copy code
cd server
npm install
Start the server

bash
Copy code
npm start
Access the GraphQL playground at http://localhost:4000/graphql to test your queries and mutations.

Server Setup
Schema Definition: Define your GraphQL schema using typeDefs.
Resolvers: Implement resolvers to handle queries and mutations.
Data Source: Connect to your database or other data sources to fetch and manipulate data.
Client-side (Frontend)
Technologies
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Apollo Client: Client-side library for integrating with a GraphQL server.
GraphQL: Query language for your API.
Getting Started
Install dependencies

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm install
Start the client

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open the client application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Client Setup
Apollo Client Configuration: Set up Apollo Client to connect to your GraphQL server.
Queries and Mutations: Use Apollo hooks (e.g., useQuery, useMutation) to interact with your GraphQL API.
UI Components: Build React components to display and manipulate data from your GraphQL server.
